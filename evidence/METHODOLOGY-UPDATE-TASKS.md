## Methodology Section Template

Add this near the top of each file (after the title and before content):

```markdown
---

## How This Document Was Created

**Source Documents:** [List the files analyzed]
**Date Generated:** 2026-02-10

[1-2 sentences explaining the extraction/analysis methodology specific to this document type]

```

## Guidelines

1. Be specific about WHAT was analyzed (file names, page counts)
2. Be clear about HOW (extraction, cross-referencing, categorization, etc.)
3. Keep it concise — 3-5 sentences max
4. Don't say "overnight" — just "during the research session"
