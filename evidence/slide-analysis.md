## Critical Evidence Gaps (Priority for Investigation)

### Priority 1: Foundational Metric Claims
1. **72% implementation rate** — How measured? Self-reported or observed?
2. **3x L&D engagement benchmark** — What benchmark? Source?
3. **68% Month 1 adoption** — Definition of "adoption"?

### Priority 2: Product Capability Claims
4. **Analytics/business impact tracking** — What can actually be measured?
5. **"Flow of work" integration** — How does learning embed in work?
6. **Three modes equal capability** — Are all three equally developed?

### Priority 3: Case Study Validation
7. **Perlego attribution** — Was improvement from Blinkist specifically?
8. **HAYS replicability** — Is 68% adoption typical or exceptional?
