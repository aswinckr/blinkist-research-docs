## Methodology

Each statistic is evaluated for:
- **Specificity:** Is the number precise or vague?
- **Source Verifiability:** Can we trace to original data?
- **Methodology Clarity:** Do we know how it was measured?
- **Recency:** Is the data current?
- **Confidence Rating:** HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW / INSUFFICIENT

## Cross-Reference: Statistics Supporting Each Gap

From [SYN-06] narrative-reality-gaps.md:

| Gap | Related Statistics | Evidence Strength |
|-----|-------------------|-------------------|
| Gap 1: Flow of work | STAT-011 (67% outside 9-5) | MEDIUM — actually contradicts flow claim |
| Gap 2: Three modes | STAT-012 (96% audio), STAT-027 (3 modes) | MEDIUM — audio dominance undermines "equal modes" |
| Gap 3: Outcome metrics | STAT-014 (72% implementation) | LOW — key claim, weak evidence |
| Gap 4: AI differentiator | None quantified | INSUFFICIENT |
| Gap 5: Perlego case | STAT-016/17/18 (NPS data) | HIGH — but attribution unclear |
| Gap 6: Business impact | STAT-014 (72%), STAT-015 (93% renewal) | MEDIUM — proxy metrics only |

## Usage Notes for Report

When citing statistics in the final report:
1. Use STAT-ID for traceability (e.g., "68% adoption [STAT-008]")
2. Include confidence rating in high-stakes claims
3. Note when consumer vs enterprise data is conflated
4. Highlight verification gaps for Priority 1 statistics
5. Cross-reference with evidence catalog IDs (E-xxx)

## Guardrails Verification

| Guardrail | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| G1: Evidence Traceability | ✅ Pass | All statistics have IDs and sources |
| G1: Source Accuracy | ⚠️ Partial | 4 statistics need external verification |
| G6: Clarity & Readability | ✅ Pass | Tables organized by category |
