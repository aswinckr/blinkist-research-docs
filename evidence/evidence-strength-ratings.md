## How This Document Was Created

**Process:** Standardized evidence rating applied to all 88 cataloged claims
**Source Documents:** claim-inventory.md (88 claims), statistics-catalog.md, quote-bank.md, case-studies-deep-dive.md, external verification research
**Date Generated:** 2026-02-10

During the research session, the AI agent evaluated each claim against standardized criteria: number of independent sources, external verifiability, methodology clarity, and direct attribution. Claims were rated 1-4 (NONE to STRONG) with confidence modifiers (✓ verified, ⚡ contradicted, ? unclear, ★ high-priority).

---

## Purpose

This document provides a definitive evidence strength rating for every claim in the Blinkist B2B sales materials. Ratings are based on standardized criteria and cross-referenced evidence from all source materials.

Use this as a quick reference for:
- Identifying high-risk claims requiring attention
- Prioritizing evidence-gathering efforts
- Supporting strategic recommendations

## Rating Criteria

| Rating | Label | Criteria |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **4** | STRONG | Multiple independent sources, externally verifiable, clear methodology, direct attribution |
| **3** | MODERATE | Single reliable source, internal data with plausible methodology, named attribution |
| **2** | WEAK | Source cited but methodology unclear, potentially conflated data, no external verification |
| **1** | NONE | No supporting evidence found, contradicted by other data, or purely aspirational |

### Confidence Modifiers

| Modifier | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **✓** | Externally verified (public source, third-party validation) |
| **⚡** | Contradicted by other evidence (reduces effective rating) |
| **?** | Methodology unknown or unclear |
| **★** | Central to sales narrative (high-priority if weak) |

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EVIDENCE STRENGTHENING

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Document 72% implementation methodology** — How is this measured? Survey? System tracking?
2. **Get analytics screenshots** — Prove what the dashboard shows
3. **Revise "flow of work" messaging** — Current evidence contradicts this positioning

### Short-Term (Month 1)
4. **Find L&D engagement benchmark source** — Validate the 3x claim
5. **Develop 2-3 more coaching case studies** — Reduce Perlego dependency
6. **Quantify Amazon case study** — "Thousands" → actual numbers

### Strategic (Quarter 1)
7. **Build workflow integrations** — Slack, Teams, HRIS triggers
8. **Shift positioning from AI to Human+AI** — Align with market evidence
9. **Create ROI calculator** — Make "prove value" claim concrete
