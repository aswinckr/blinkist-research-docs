## Why the Shift Is Happening

### 1. Compliance ROI is Questionable
**[E-CVD-04]:**
> Only **10% of employees** find traditional compliance training impacts their actual work.
> — Google AI Overview, citing industry research

**[E-CVD-05]:**
> Traditional compliance programs show low behavior change and engagement. Annual training check-the-box exercises are being replaced by embedded controls.

### 2. Skills Gaps Are More Urgent
**[E-CVD-06]:**
> **70% of organizations** report significant skills gaps within their workforce — threatening ability to deliver on strategic goals.
> — Fosway Digital Learning Realities 2024

**[E-CVD-07]:**
> Only **12% of organizations** rated their upskilling efforts as "very effective."
> — Fosway 2024

### 3. ROI Pressure Demands Measurable Outcomes
**[E-CVD-08]:**
> Decision-makers now demand evidence of Return on Investment (ROI), and **skills development offers clearer pathways to demonstrate tangible benefits** such as improved productivity, innovation, and employee retention.
> — Edflex/Fosway Webinar Analysis

### 4. The Compliance Model Is Transforming
**[E-CVD-09] Gartner Framework:**
The shift is moving from "training-first" to "embedded controls":
- **Traditional:** Annual training events, check-box completion
- **Emerging:** Learning in the flow of work, just-in-time reminders
- **Future:** AI-powered contextual guidance, real-time compliance nudges
