## Executive Summary

Enterprise L&D platform procurement is a **structured, multi-stage process** typically spanning 16-24 weeks for large organizations. The 2024-2025 market is characterized by:

- **Shift to AI-enhanced platforms:** AI capabilities are now table stakes, not differentiators
- **Integration-first evaluation:** Workflow embedding (Slack, Teams, HRIS) is critical buying criterion
- **ROI pressure intensified:** 57% of buyers expect ROI within 3 months of implementation
- **Procurement complexity increasing:** Average 5-7 stakeholders in Decision-Making Unit (DMU)

**Blinkist Strategic Advantage:** Fast implementation (2-4 weeks) enables Blinkist to shorten the overall procurement-to-value cycle by 60-80% compared to competitors.
