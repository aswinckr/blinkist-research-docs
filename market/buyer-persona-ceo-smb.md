## Executive Summary

The SMB CEO is a distinct buyer profile from the L&D Director or CHRO. In small and medium businesses (10-250 employees), the CEO often makes or heavily influences learning platform decisions directly. In 2025, SMB CEOs are operating in "survival-to-strategy" mode — managing tight budgets, talent shortages, and the pressure to adopt AI while remaining operationally involved in their businesses.

**Key insight:** SMB CEOs don't buy "learning platforms" — they buy **time, capability, and competitive advantage**. Blinkist's 15-minute format and leadership focus directly addresses this buyer's core constraints.
