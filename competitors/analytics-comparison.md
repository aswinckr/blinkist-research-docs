| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Learner tracking | ✓ Full |
| Skills intelligence | ⚪ Partial |

## Analytics Feature Deep-Dive

### Skills Intelligence [COMP-AN-033]

Skills analytics is the emerging battleground. Current leaders:

| Platform | Skills Capability | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| **Degreed Skills+** | Advanced | Skill inference, gap analysis, forecasting |
| **Cornerstone Transform** | Advanced | Part of Galaxy AI suite |
| **Docebo (365Talents)** | Advanced | Recent acquisition boost |
| **Skillsoft Skills+** | Moderate | Workforce readiness focus |
| **LinkedIn Career Hub** | Moderate | Network-powered insights |
| **Others** | Basic/None | Emerging capability |

**Blinkist Gap:** No visible skills intelligence offering. This is an emerging enterprise requirement that Blinkist would need to address for larger deals.

### Business Impact Reporting [COMP-AN-034]

ROI demonstration is increasingly critical. Current leaders:

| Platform | Business Impact Capability | Evidence Quality |
|----------|---------------------------|------------------|
| **Cornerstone** | Forrester TEI methodology, calculator | HIGH |
| **Docebo** | Named case studies with $ figures | HIGH |
| **LinkedIn** | Claims (5x engagement, 3.4x AI growth) | MEDIUM (no methodology) |
| **Coursera** | Forrester recognition | MEDIUM |
| **Blinkist** | 72% implementation claim | LOW (no methodology) |

**Blinkist Gap:** The 72% implementation claim lacks methodology documentation. This is a CRITICAL gap identified in Phase 1 evidence analysis.

### Compliance Reporting [COMP-AN-035]

Critical for regulated industries (healthcare, finance, government):

| Platform | Compliance Strength | Industries |
|----------|-------------------|------------|
| **Cornerstone** | Enterprise-grade | All regulated |
| **Skillsoft** | Strong | Especially government |
| **Docebo** | Strong (FedRAMP) | Government, healthcare |
| **Coursera** | CEU/CPE tracking | Professional services |
| **Blinkist** | Unknown | — |

**Blinkist Gap:** Compliance tracking not emphasized. May limit enterprise deals in regulated industries.

## Reporting Frequency & Access [COMP-AN-036]

| Platform | Real-Time | Scheduled | Export | API |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|-----|
| Cornerstone | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

| Skillsoft | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 360Learning | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

| **MEDIUM** | Position simplicity as feature | "Actionable insights without complexity" |

---

## Analytics Decision Factors for Buyers [COMP-AN-043]

Based on competitor analysis, enterprise L&D buyers evaluate analytics on:

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Ease of Use** | High | Can admins extract insights without training? |
| **Integration** | High | Does it connect to existing HR/LMS stack? |
| **Business Impact** | High | Can we prove ROI to leadership? |
| **Skills Intelligence** | Medium-High | Does it track skill development? |
| **Compliance** | Medium-High (regulated) | Can we track regulatory requirements? |
| **Custom Reports** | Medium | Can we build ad-hoc reports? |
| **Export/API** | Medium | Can we extract data for other systems? |
| **Real-Time** | Medium | Is data current or delayed? |

---

## Summary

**Analytics Landscape:** Enterprise platforms (Cornerstone, Degreed, Docebo) lead on analytics depth but trade off simplicity. Mid-market platforms offer good balance. Blinkist's analytics are the least documented publicly.

**Key Insight:** Skills intelligence and business impact reporting are emerging differentiators. Blinkist has gaps in both areas but could position "simple, actionable analytics" as a feature for buyers overwhelmed by enterprise complexity.

**Critical Action:** The 72% implementation claim MUST be backed by documented methodology before including in sales materials.
