# AI Features Audit — Competitor Analysis

**Task:** Task 28 — What AI each competitor has shipped, how they position it
**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Evidence IDs:** COMP-AI-001 through COMP-AI-045

---

## Executive Summary

AI is fully commoditized in enterprise L&D. Every major competitor has shipped AI features across 5 core capability areas. The differentiation window for "having AI" has closed — the new battleground is AI execution quality and human+AI integration.

### Key Findings

1. **AI is table stakes** — 10/10 competitors have AI-powered recommendations and search
2. **AI coaching is everywhere** — 9/10 competitors offer AI coaching/role-play (only 360Learning doesn't emphasize it)
3. **Content generation is the new frontier** — 8/10 have AI course builders
4. **Skills intelligence is emerging** — 6/10 have dedicated AI skills mapping
5. **No competitor has human coaching** — This is Blinkist's only true differentiation

## Strategic Implications for Blinkist

### 1. AI Is Not a Differentiator

**Finding:** Every competitor has AI. Blinkist cannot win on "we have AI."

**Implication:** Shift positioning from AI-as-feature to AI+Human unique combination.

**Evidence:** COMP-AI-022, E-LDT-02 ("AI makes human-led learning MORE valuable")

**Recommendation:** Stop leading with AI in sales narrative; lead with outcomes and human touch.

**Evidence ID:** COMP-AI-023

---

### 2. Skills Intelligence Is the New Battleground

**Finding:** 6/10 competitors have dedicated skills intelligence:
- Degreed (Skills+, Maestro)
- Skillsoft (Skills+)
- Docebo (365Talents acquisition)
- Cornerstone (Galaxy AI)
- LinkedIn (Career Hub)
- Go1 (Morgan)

**Implication:** Skills-based organization trend requires skills data layer — Blinkist lacks this.

**Recommendation:** Consider skills integration partnership or acquisition to compete.

**Evidence ID:** COMP-AI-024

---

### 3. Human Coaching Is THE Whitespace

**Finding:** 0/10 competitors offer human coaching. All offer AI coaching/role-play.

**Evidence:**
- LinkedIn Learning: AI role-play only
- Coursera: AI Coach only
- Udemy: AI Role Play only
- Skillsoft: CAISY AI only
- Docebo: Virtual Coaching (AI) only
- Cornerstone: AI coaching only

**Implication:** Human coaching is Blinkist's only unique capability in the market.

**Recommendation:** Double down on human coaching as primary differentiator. This aligns with workshop evidence (E-WS-03: "5 Human Blockers").

**Evidence ID:** COMP-AI-025

---

### 4. "Flow of Work" Claim Is Challenged

**Finding:** Go1's Morgan AI Agent delivers learning directly in Slack/Teams.

**Implication:** Blinkist's "learning shows up where needed" claim faces direct competition.

**Evidence:** COMP-GO1-001, GAP-C1 (core tagline has contradicting evidence)

**Recommendation:** Either build true flow-of-work integration OR stop making this claim.

**Evidence ID:** COMP-AI-026

---

### 5. Content Creation AI Is Table Stakes

**Finding:** 8/10 competitors have AI course builders:
- Coursera (AI Course Builder)
- Udemy (limited)
- 360Learning (AI Course Builder)
- Docebo (Content Creator)
- LinkedIn Learning (AI-assisted curation)
- Skillsoft (limited)
- Degreed (Open Library)

**Implication:** L&D buyers expect AI content creation tools.

**Recommendation:** Consider AI-assisted curation or summarization features.

**Evidence ID:** COMP-AI-027

## Summary

AI is commoditized. Every competitor has it. Blinkist's only unique capability is human coaching — the one thing no competitor offers. The strategic recommendation is clear:

**Stop positioning on AI. Start positioning on Human + AI.**

This aligns with:
- Skillsoft's "Human + AI Skills" positioning (but execute better)
- Workshop evidence on "5 Human Blockers"
- L&D Trends finding: "AI makes human-led learning MORE valuable"

The market has answered the question. Blinkist should listen.
