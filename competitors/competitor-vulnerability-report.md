- **Attack Skillsoft** — clearest vulnerability (dated, declining)
- **Emphasize pricing** — 96% cheaper than Coursera at scale

### 2. Near-Term (Next Quarter)
- **Acquire or partner for coaching** — CoachHub validates market
- **Build skills intelligence** — emerging battleground (6/10 have it)
- **Develop completion rate proof** — counter long-form platform weakness

### 3. Strategic (This Year)
