## 7. Content Model Analysis

### Pure Curation (Blinkist Model)
- **Philosophy:** Quality over quantity — every piece professionally vetted
- **Advantages:** Consistent quality, trusted recommendations, no content overload
- **Disadvantages:** Smaller library, less variety, dependent on curation judgment
- **Competitors using this model:** LinkedIn Learning, Coursera

### Aggregation Model (Go1/Degreed)
- **Philosophy:** Maximize choice by aggregating multiple providers
- **Advantages:** Massive library, one-stop-shop, flexibility
- **Disadvantages:** Variable quality, overwhelming choice, search/discovery friction
- **Competitors using this model:** Go1, Degreed, Skillsoft (to some extent)

### Marketplace Model (Udemy)
- **Philosophy:** Let the market determine quality through ratings/reviews
- **Advantages:** Constant new content, instructor diversity, price competition
- **Disadvantages:** Quality varies significantly, requires learner evaluation skills

### User-Generated Model (360Learning)
- **Philosophy:** SMEs create content for peer learning

- **Disadvantages:** Variable production quality, requires SME time investment

### Blinkist Unique Position
Blinkist is the only platform that:
1. **Curates external expert knowledge** (not internal SME or instructor-created)
2. **Standardizes format** (every piece is 15 minutes)
3. **Prioritizes audio** (commute/workout friendly)
4. **Focuses on books** (highest-vetted content — publishers already filter)
