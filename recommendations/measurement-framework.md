# Measurement Framework — Tracking Strategic Success

*Phase 7: Recommendations — Task 123*
*Created: 2026-02-10 08:56 Berlin*
*Evidence Foundation: Recommendation Stack, 90-Day Action Plan, Phase 1-6 research*

---

## Executive Summary

This framework establishes how Blinkist measures success across all 10 strategic recommendations. Each recommendation has **leading indicators** (early signals) and **lagging indicators** (outcome measures), with clear baselines, targets, and measurement methods.

### Measurement Philosophy
1. **Evidence-based baselines** — Use existing data from Phase 1 research where available
2. **Leading before lagging** — Track early signals before outcomes appear
3. **Behavior before business** — Measure user/prospect behavior changes first
4. **Confidence levels** — Flag metrics with methodology gaps [GAP-C2]

## Recommendation 1: Reposition to "Human-Powered, AI-Enhanced"

### Why This Matters
Evidence shows AI is 100% commoditized [COMP-AI-001] while human coaching is THE whitespace [COMP-CH-010]. Success means prospects perceive Blinkist as differentiated from AI-only competitors.

### Leading Indicators (Weeks 1-4)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Positioning test positive responses | N/A | 80% favorable | Post-call survey (5 questions) | Per call |
| Sales team confidence score | Survey Week 1 | +20 pts | Internal NPS on positioning | Weekly |
| Prospect "human" mentions in calls | 0 | 50% of calls | Gong/call recording keyword analysis | Weekly |
| Deck engagement time (human slides) | Establish baseline | +25% | Docsend/tracking | Per send |

**Evidence IDs:** [COMP-AI-001], [COMP-CH-010], [E-LDT-02]

### Lagging Indicators (Months 2-6)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Win rate vs. AI-only competitors | Establish Month 1 | +10% | CRM won/lost analysis | Monthly |
| Average deal size | €X (current) | +15% | CRM deal value | Monthly |
| Sales cycle length | X days (current) | -10% | CRM stage duration | Monthly |
| Competitive displacement wins | X/quarter | +25% | CRM competitor field | Quarterly |

## Recommendation 2: Make Coaching the Hero Product

### Why This Matters
Perlego's +41 NPS improvement [Q-003] is the strongest evidence of impact — it came from Coaching. The 91% engagement spike [STAT-025] proves human moments amplify AI content.

### Leading Indicators (Weeks 1-4)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Coaching inquiries per week | Establish Week 1 | +50% | Sales inquiry tagging | Weekly |
| Coaching mentions in discovery calls | Track Week 1 | 80% of calls | Gong keyword analysis | Weekly |
| Coach recruitment applications | N/A | 50 applications | ATS tracking | Monthly |
| Coaching product page visits | Current | +100% | Google Analytics | Weekly |

**Evidence IDs:** [Q-003], [STAT-025], [COMP-CH-040], [COMP-CH-044]

### Lagging Indicators (Months 2-6)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Coaching revenue as % of total B2B | Est. 15-20% | 25-30% | Finance reporting | Monthly |
| Coaching NPS | +41 (Perlego) | +40 average | Post-program survey | Per cohort |
| Coaching-attached deal win rate | Establish | +20% vs. non-coaching | CRM analysis | Quarterly |
| Coaching retention rate | N/A | 85% renew | Renewal tracking | Quarterly |

### Key Success Signal
**If coaching-attached deals have 20%+ higher win rates within 6 months, the strategy is validated.**

---

## Recommendation 3: Document 72% Implementation Methodology

### Why This Matters
The 72% implementation rate [STAT-014] is a critical ROI claim with ZERO methodology documentation [GAP-C2]. This creates immediate credibility risk.

### Leading Indicators (Week 1-2)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Methodology documentation complete | ❌ None | ✅ Complete | Binary check | Week 1 |
| Sales team trained on methodology | 0% | 100% | Training completion | Week 1 |
| One-pager created and distributed | ❌ None | ✅ Complete | Binary check | Week 1 |
| Talk track confidence (internal) | Survey | 90% confident | Internal survey | Week 2 |

**Evidence IDs:** [STAT-014], [GAP-C2], [COMP-AN-034]

### Lagging Indicators (Months 1-3)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| "How do you measure this?" objections | Track Week 1 | <5% of calls | Gong objection tracking | Weekly |
| Deal lost to "unsubstantiated claims" | Track | 0 | CRM loss reason | Monthly |
| Prospect confidence in ROI claims | Survey | 85%+ confident | Post-demo survey | Per demo |

### Success Criteria
**PASS: Methodology documented, objection rate <5%, zero deals lost to credibility concerns.**

---

## Recommendation 4: Build the 91% Activation Story

### Why This Matters
The 91% engagement spike after Live Sessions [STAT-025] is the PROOF that Human + AI > AI alone. This metric differentiates Blinkist from every competitor.

### Leading Indicators (Weeks 1-4)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| 91% story in sales deck | ❌ Not prominent | ✅ Hero slide | Deck audit | Week 1 |
| 91% mentioned in discovery calls | 0% | 100% | Gong keyword analysis | Weekly |
| One-pager distributed to team | ❌ None | ✅ Complete | Binary check | Week 1 |
| Website homepage featuring stat | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Homepage audit | Week 4 |

**Evidence IDs:** [STAT-025], [E-LDT-02], [E-VID-01]

### Lagging Indicators (Months 2-6)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Prospect unprompted recall of stat | 0% | 40%+ | Post-call survey | Monthly |
| "Why not LinkedIn Learning?" handled | Track | 80%+ successfully | Gong analysis | Monthly |
| Live Session attachment rate | Current | +30% | Product analytics | Monthly |

---

## Recommendation 5: Create Tiered Product Structure

### Why This Matters
Current pricing lacks transparency compared to 4/10 competitors [COMP-PM-011]. A tiered structure enables upsell path and clearer value communication.

### Leading Indicators (Weeks 5-8)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Tier structure defined | ❌ None | ✅ 4 tiers | Product spec | Week 6 |
| Pricing page live | ❌ None | ✅ Live | Website check | Week 8 |
| Sales team trained on tiers | 0% | 100% | Training completion | Week 8 |
| Tier selection in quotes | N/A | 100% | CRM field | Weekly |

**Evidence IDs:** [COMP-PM-011], [COMP-PM-001], [PREC-GE-010]

### Lagging Indicators (Months 3-6)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Tier upgrade rate (Q1 → Q2) | N/A | 15% | CRM tier tracking | Quarterly |
| Average deal size by tier | Establish | Coaching tier 2x base | CRM analysis | Monthly |
| Win rate by tier | Establish | Coaching tier +15% | CRM analysis | Quarterly |
| Tier 4 (Enterprise+) penetration | N/A | 10% of new deals | CRM analysis | Quarterly |

---

## Recommendation 6: Develop 3+ Coaching Case Studies

### Why This Matters
Only 1 case study (Perlego) has hard metrics [Q-003]. Enterprises need social proof from peers. Named speakers increase credibility [CS-001, CS-002 now attributed].

### Leading Indicators (Weeks 2-8)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Case study interviews completed | 1 | 4 | Interview tracker | Weekly |
| Case studies with named speakers | 1 | 4 | Case study audit | Weekly |
| Case studies with hard metrics | 1 | 3 | Case study audit | Weekly |
| Case studies published | 1 | 4 | Website check | Week 8 |

**Evidence IDs:** [Q-003], [CS-001], [CS-002], [CS-007]

### Lagging Indicators (Months 2-6)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Case study views/downloads | Establish | +200% | Analytics | Monthly |
| Case study mentions in won deals | Track | 50%+ | CRM/Gong | Monthly |
| "Similar company" objection rate | Track | -50% | Gong analysis | Monthly |

---

## Recommendation 7: Secure LinkedIn Learning Hub Partnership

### Why This Matters
getAbstract (Blinkist competitor) is already a LinkedIn Hub partner [COMP-INT-011]. Blinkist is NOT. This is a distribution gap that could accelerate enterprise penetration.

### Leading Indicators (Weeks 5-12)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| LinkedIn contact identified | ❌ None | ✅ Yes | BD tracker | Week 5 |
| Initial meeting scheduled | ❌ None | ✅ Yes | Calendar | Week 6 |
| Partnership pitch delivered | ❌ None | ✅ Yes | BD tracker | Week 8 |
| LOI/term sheet received | ❌ None | ✅ Yes | BD tracker | Week 12 |

**Evidence IDs:** [COMP-INT-011], [COMP-INT-005]

### Lagging Indicators (Months 4-12)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Partnership signed | ❌ None | ✅ Yes | Contract | Month 4-6 |
| Leads from LinkedIn Hub | 0 | 50/month | Attribution tracking | Monthly |
| LinkedIn Hub revenue contribution | 0 | €500K/year | Finance | Annually |

---

## Recommendation 8: Build Slack/Teams Integration

### Why This Matters
Go1's Morgan agent delivers learning in Slack/Teams [COMP-GO1-001]. This directly challenges Blinkist's "flow of work" claim. Integration is table stakes for enterprise.

### Leading Indicators (Weeks 8-12)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Integration MVP spec complete | ❌ None | ✅ Yes | Product spec | Week 8 |
| Engineering sprint allocated | ❌ None | ✅ Yes | Sprint planning | Week 9 |
| Beta integration live | ❌ None | ✅ Yes | Product check | Week 12 |
| Pilot customers identified | 0 | 10 | Sales pipeline | Week 10 |

**Evidence IDs:** [COMP-GO1-001], [GAP-C1], [E-VID-07]

### Lagging Indicators (Months 4-9)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Integration pilot signups | 0 | 50 | Product analytics | Monthly |
| Integration DAU/WAU | N/A | 30%+ DAU/MAU | Product analytics | Monthly |
| "Flow of work" claim validated | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Usage data | Month 6 |
| Integration-attached deal win rate | Establish | +15% | CRM analysis | Quarterly |

---

## Recommendation 9: Create Accountability Tracking Platform

### Why This Matters
Tracking application of learning (Stage 4: Application) is where all competitors are weak [COMP-AN-033]. Building this creates a true differentiator and strengthens the 72% claim.

### Leading Indicators (Weeks 9-13)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Platform requirements defined | ❌ None | ✅ Yes | Product spec | Week 10 |
| MVP development started | ❌ None | ✅ Yes | Sprint tracking | Week 11 |
| Beta testers recruited | 0 | 20 | Beta signup | Week 12 |
| Beta live | ❌ None | ✅ Yes | Product check | Week 13+ |

**Evidence IDs:** [GAP-C2], [COMP-AN-033], [E-LDT-04]

### Lagging Indicators (Months 4-12)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Application rate measured | Unknown | 72%+ validated | Platform data | Quarterly |
| Manager engagement with platform | N/A | 50%+ active | Product analytics | Monthly |
| Learning-to-application time | Unknown | <2 weeks | Platform data | Monthly |
| Platform NPS | N/A | +50 | Survey | Quarterly |

---

## Recommendation 10: Launch Enterprise Repositioning Campaign

### Why This Matters
Once positioning is validated internally and with prospects, external market perception must shift. Campaign amplifies the Human + AI message to the broader market.

### Leading Indicators (Weeks 8-13)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Campaign creative developed | ❌ None | ✅ Yes | Creative review | Week 10 |
| Campaign channels identified | ❌ None | ✅ 3+ channels | Media plan | Week 11 |
| Budget allocated | ❌ None | ✅ €X allocated | Finance | Week 11 |
| Campaign launched | ❌ None | ✅ Yes | Campaign tracker | Week 13 |

**Evidence IDs:** [COMP-CH-010], [PREC-BU-010], [E-LDT-02]

### Lagging Indicators (Months 4-9)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Aided brand awareness | Establish | +15% | Brand tracking survey | Quarterly |
| "Human-powered" association | Establish | 30%+ | Brand tracking | Quarterly |
| Inbound enterprise leads | Current | +40% | Marketing attribution | Monthly |
| Campaign ROI | N/A | 3:1 minimum | Finance | Quarterly |

---

## Cross-Recommendation Health Metrics

These metrics indicate overall strategic health across all recommendations:

| Metric | Current State | 90-Day Target | 180-Day Target | Owner |
|--------|---------------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Overall B2B win rate | Establish | +10% | +20% | Sales |
| Average deal size | Establish | +15% | +25% | Sales |
| Net Revenue Retention | Establish | 100%+ | 110%+ | CS |
| Customer NPS | Establish | +40 | +50 | CS |
| Time to close (enterprise) | Establish | -10% | -20% | Sales |
| Coaching revenue % | Est. 15-20% | 25% | 35% | Finance |
| Competitor displacement wins | Establish | +25% | +50% | Sales |

---

## Evidence Gaps in Measurement

These gaps should be addressed as part of implementation:

| Gap | Impact | Resolution | Owner |
|-----|--------|------------|-------|
| 72% methodology undocumented [GAP-C2] | Cannot validate core claim | Document by Day 2 | Research |
| Win rate by competitor unknown | Cannot measure competitive displacement | Add CRM field | Sales Ops |
| Coaching attachment rate unknown | Cannot measure R2 success | Add CRM field | Sales Ops |
| Brand awareness baseline unknown | Cannot measure R10 success | Commission survey | Marketing |
