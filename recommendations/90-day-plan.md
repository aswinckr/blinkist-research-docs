## Risk Management

### Critical Path Dependencies

```
CRITICAL PATH ANALYSIS

Week 2: Quick Wins Complete
    │
    ├── If QW1 (72% Methodology) fails → DELAY MB4 (can't position without proof)
    │
    ├── If QW5 (Perlego Case) fails → DELAY MB2 (no template for other cases)
    │
    └── If QW3 (Named Speakers) blocked → PROCEED (fallback: focus on Perlego)

Week 6: Medium Bets In Progress
    │
    ├── If MB4 (Positioning) fails testing → ITERATE (test 3 more options)
    │
    ├── If MB2 (Case Studies) interviews blocked → EXPAND candidate list
    │
    └── If MB3 (LinkedIn) not responding → PIVOT to Degreed/Go1 expansion

Week 10: Medium Bets Complete
    │
    ├── If MB1 (Tiers) engineering delayed → LAUNCH without tier gating (manual)
    │
    └── If MB5 (Campaign) underperforms → REALLOCATE budget to events

Week 13: Strategic Bet Foundation
    │
    ├── If coaching targets unavailable → PIVOT to partnership over acquisition
    │
    └── If skills complexity > expected → DESCOPE to 100 core skills
```

### Contingency Plans

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| Analytics team unavailable for 72% doc | LOW | HIGH | Pre-book time | Use existing documentation, note gaps |
| HAYS/Amazon legal block | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Early escalation | Focus on Perlego + new cases |
| LinkedIn partnership rejected | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Strong pitch | Pursue Degreed/Go1 expansion |
| Tier engineering delayed | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Phased approach | Manual tier management initially |
| Positioning test fails | LOW | HIGH | 3 options tested | Iterate with new options, extend timeline |
