Three problems identified:
1. Learning tools aren't used (~20% typical adoption)
2. Skills deteriorate faster than developed
3. Can't prove ROI

| Problem | Evidence Source | Rating |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Low adoption | [SRC-02], [E-LDT-04] | ★★★★ HIGH |
| Skill decay | L&D Trends PDF | ★★★☆ MEDIUM |
